# Target iOS
## Installing dependencies

You will need Node, Watchman, the React Native command line interface, and Xcode.

While you can use any editor of your choice to develop your app, you will need to install Xcode in order to set up the necessary tooling to build your React Native app for iOS.

<h3>Node &amp; Watchman</h3>

We recommend installing Node and Watchman using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). Run the following commands in a Terminal after installing Homebrew:

```sh
brew install node
brew install watchman
```
We can use Yarn for manage packages `brew install yarn`

If you have already installed Node on your system, make sure it is Node 8.3 or newer.

<h3>Xcode &amp; CocoaPods</h3>

The easiest way to install Xcode is via the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12). Installing Xcode will also install the iOS Simulator and all the necessary tools to build your iOS app.

If you have already installed Xcode on your system, make sure it is version 9.4 or newer.

<h4>Command Line Tools</h4>

You will also need to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. Open Xcode, then choose "Preferences..." from the Xcode menu. Go to the Locations panel and install the tools by selecting the most recent version in the Command Line Tools dropdown.

<h4>Installing an iOS Simulator in Xcode</h4>

To install a simulator, open <strong>Xcode > Preferences...</strong> and select the <strong>Components</strong> tab. Select a simulator with the corresponding version of iOS you wish to use.

<h4>CocoaPods</h4>

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is built with Ruby and it will be installable with the default Ruby available on macOS. You can use a Ruby Version manager, however we recommend that you use the standard Ruby available on macOS unless you know what you're doing.

Using the default Ruby install will require you to use `sudo` when installing gems. (This is only an issue for the duration of the gem installation, though.)

```sh
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

# Target Android
## Installing dependencies

You will need Node, Watchman, the React Native command line interface, a JDK, and Android Studio.

While you can use any editor of your choice to develop your app, you will need to install Android Studio in order to set up the necessary tooling to build your React Native app for Android.

<h3>Node &amp; Watchman</h3>

We recommend installing Node and Watchman using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). Run the following commands in a Terminal after installing Homebrew:

```sh
brew install node
brew install watchman
```
We can use Yarn for manage packages `brew install yarn`

If you have already installed Node on your system, make sure it is Node 8.3 or newer.

<h3>Java Development Kit</h3>

We recommend installing JDK using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). Run the following commands in a Terminal after installing Homebrew:

```sh
brew cask install adoptopenjdk/openjdk/adoptopenjdk8
```

If you have already installed JDK on your system, make sure it is JDK 8 or newer.


<h4>1. Install Android Studio</h4>

[Download and install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html). Choose a "Custom" setup when prompted to select an installation type. Make sure the boxes next to all of the following are checked:

<block class="native mac windows android" />

- `Android SDK`
- `Android SDK Platform`
- `Android Virtual Device`
- If you are not already using Hyper-V: `Performance (Intel ® HAXM)` ([See here for AMD or Hyper-V](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/07/android-emulator-amd-processor-hyper-v.html))

Then, click "Next" to install all of these components.

> If the checkboxes are grayed out, you will have a chance to install these components later on.

Once setup has finalized and you're presented with the Welcome screen, proceed to the next step.

<h4>2. Install the Android SDK</h4>

Android Studio installs the latest Android SDK by default. Building a React Native app with native code, however, requires the `Android 10 (Q)` SDK in particular. Additional Android SDKs can be installed through the SDK Manager in Android Studio.

The SDK Manager can be accessed from the "Welcome to Android Studio" screen. Click on "Configure", then select "SDK Manager".

> The SDK Manager can also be found within the Android Studio "Preferences" dialog, under **Appearance & Behavior** → **System Settings** → **Android SDK**.

Select the "SDK Platforms" tab from within the SDK Manager, then check the box next to "Show Package Details" in the bottom right corner. Look for and expand the `Android 10 (Q)` entry, then make sure the following items are checked:

- `Android SDK Platform 29`
- `Intel x86 Atom_64 System Image` or `Google APIs Intel x86 Atom System Image`

Next, select the "SDK Tools" tab and check the box next to "Show Package Details" here as well. Look for and expand the "Android SDK Build-Tools" entry, then make sure that `29.0.2` is selected.

Finally, click "Apply" to download and install the Android SDK and related build tools.

<h4>3. Configure the ANDROID_HOME environment variable</h4>

The React Native tools require some environment variables to be set up in order to build apps with native code.

Add the following lines to your `$HOME/.bash_profile` or `$HOME/.bashrc` (if you are using `zsh` then `~/.zprofile` or `~/.zshrc`) config file:

```sh
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```
> `.bash_profile` is specific to `bash`. If you're using another shell, you will need to edit the appropriate shell-specific config file.

Type `source $HOME/.bash_profile` to load the config into your current shell. Verify that ANDROID_HOME has been added to your path by running `echo $PATH`.

> Please make sure you use the correct Android SDK path. You can find the actual location of the SDK in the Android Studio "Preferences" dialog, under **Appearance & Behavior** → **System Settings** → **Android SDK**.
